We are going to create a project on CircleCI on which we will Test ïƒ  Build ïƒ  Deploy our python application
So, what is exactly CircleCI ??
The name itself contains CI which mean Continuous Integration. It is way faster than Jenkins. As we donâ€™t have to setup a separately dedicated server and manage plugins and extensions as we do on Jenkins.
I will walk through the project.
I created a basic python application, which I integrated with GitHub
So, once we have pushed our code to the GitHub, we will create a config file, in which we will be defining our workflow.
 
Then we go for signing into CircleCI.And Itâ€™s FreeeeðŸ˜Ž
